- - - - - - - ANTS - - - - - - -
  - ant behavior
    - follow pheromones more readily
      - when you're on the line for following everything looks basically the same
    - food retrieval
      - ants are trying to pick stuff up and failing repeatedly
        - because of a move and pickup queued together?
    - fight/grapple
      - damage never being dealt
      - fix sprite ordering
      - alert pheromone inconsistent (and probably shouldn't be rendered)
  - scenario:
    - touch and drag to add pheromone
      - allow switching between level editor modes and mouse mode
      - interpolate follow pheromone placement (and quantities) - see mouseThunks
    - food spawn system
    - add score
      - enemies killed, ants spawned?

- - - - - - - FIX - - - - - - - -

- - - - GAME MECHANICS - - - - -
  - Spider, beetle, scorpion instead of plain food, at least after a bit
  - Score based on food, enemies killed?
  - Enemies spawn faster but you're stronger?
  - Briefly control a scorpion or something?
  - Balance towards losing eventually?
