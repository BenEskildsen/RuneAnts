  - ant behavior
    - fight/grapple
      - damage never being dealt
      - fix sprite ordering
      - alert pheromone inconsistent (and probably shouldn't be rendered)
  - scenario:
    - touch and drag to add pheromone
      - level editor mode for not interfering with mouse
    - food spawn system


- - - - - POLISH - - - - -
  - Remove main menu
    - hotkey for opening level editor
  - Add music from Antocracy
  - Dead ants
  - make base look like an ant hill
  - favicon + name


- - - - - - RUNE INTEGRATION - - - - -
  - Rune script include
  - Rune api calls
  - game over when ants are all killed or something?


- - - - - - - FIX - - - - - - - -
  - ants are trying to pick stuff up and failing repeatedly
  - ants will continuously turn around when very close to the colony
  - pheromoneWorker appears to not update after reset in level editor


- - - - GAME MECHANICS - - - - -
  - Spider, beetle, scorpion instead of plain food, at least after a bit
  - Score based on food, enemies killed?
  - Enemies spawn faster but you're stronger?
  - Briefly control a scorpion or something?
  - Balance towards losing eventually?


- - - - - - REFACTOR - - - - - -
  - clean up config
  - Use UI components package
  - Use utils components package
